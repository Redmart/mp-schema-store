# mp-schema-store

This repository is to host schema store to be used in MP Services.
The source is taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/62af196e39b96d574627792faba4ecc926a237e3/src/schemas/json/json-patch.json.

The original schema store http://json.schemastore.org/json-patch was updated in May 2020 causing allOf definition to get removed, while this is used for some of old services.
